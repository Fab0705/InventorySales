# InventorySales
## ðŸ“Œ Description
This API project is the core of a robust and secure backend system designed to provide inventory management and sales processing services to client applications (such as web, mobile, or point-of-sale (POS) applications). It solves the critical problem of decentralization and lack of integrity in small business data, acting as a single source of truth that ensures consistency, accuracy, and security across all operations.
### Problem that Solves
Mini-shops using disconnected solutions (multiple spreadsheets, desktop software without integration) face significant challenges:
- Fragmented and Inconsistent Data
- Security Vulnerabilities
- Lack of Scalability and Integration
- Decentralized Business Logic
### Value and Utility of the API Solution
This API is the cornerstone of solving these problems, offering a reliable and well-defined service layer:
-  Centralization and Consistency : As an API, all clients (web, mobile, POS) consume the same endpoints, ensuring that business logicâ€”such as discounting inventory when recording a saleâ€”is applied uniformly and consistently to all clients, eliminating data fragmentation.
- Scalability and Efficient Integration: Its nature as a RESTful API (or GraphQL) allows for the agile development of multiple frontends (React, Angular, Vue, React Native, Flutter) and easy integration with third-party services (payment gateways, accounting systems, marketplaces), future-proofing the business for growth.
- Maintainability and Technical Simplicity: By encapsulating all complex logic and business rules in the backend, front-end clients become simpler, thinner, and easier to maintain. Developers can update the logic in a single location (the API) with the confidence that all consumption points will immediately benefit.
## ðŸš€ Technologies used
The API project is built on a modern and robust .NET technology stack, curated to ensure high performance, security, maintainability, and an efficient development experience.
### Main Platform and Frameworks
- ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET 8): The premier framework for building high-performance RESTful web services. .NET 8 provides significant efficiency improvements, JSON serialization, and native tooling for building scalable, modern APIs, serving as the solid and secure foundation for your entire application.
### Data Management and Persistence
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore (EF Core): Used as the primary ORM (Object-Relational Mapper). EF Core simplifies data access by allowing you to work with the database using .NET objects instead of direct SQL code, facilitating CRUD operations, transaction management, and change tracking.
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer: The SQL Server-specific database provider that enables EF Core to translate .NET entity operations into efficient T-SQL commands for interacting with the relational database.
### Security and Cryptography
- Isopoh.Cryptography.Argon2: A specialized library for password hashing. It implements the Argon2 algorithm, winner of the Password Hashing Competition and currently considered one of the most secure algorithms for this task. It is resistant to brute-force attacks, GPU cracking, and side-channel attacks, protecting user credentials even in the event of a data breach. It uses Isopoh.Cryptography.Blake2 internally for its functionality.
### API Documentation and Testing
- Swashbuckle.AspNetCore: A fundamental tool for interactive API documentation. It automatically generates a Swagger UI from the metadata of controllers, endpoints, models, and response schemas. This allows developers to visualize, test, and interact with all API endpoints directly from the browser, greatly streamlining development and integration testing.
### Development Tools
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools: Provides EF Core CLI commands for the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio. These tools are essential for implementing the Code-First paradigm, generating and applying database migrations to manage schema changes in a versioned and consistent manner.
